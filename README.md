# Awesome macOS

## Core

### Package Manager (Homebrew)

This is the package manager which is used to install many of the things mentioned below.

## Terminal (Kitty)

I personally use [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) as my terminal. I enjoy it mainly due to the fact that it is fast & lightweight.

I used to be of the mindset that the more features a terminal had the better which is why I enjoyed Warp so much it made everything easy out of the box. 
I am currently at a phase in my software development where I am trying to customize everything I use, and personalize it for my specific needs.

### Powerline10k 

[Powerline10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) is what makes the terminal prompt look beautiful. The important thing here is too make sure you install Nerd Font as well.
My configuration mainly just has the prompt styled how I like it. I just modified the original file that was generated by powerline which is why it is so large.

[Configuration File](./.p10k.zsh)

### zsh-autosuggestions

[This](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) gives terminal command suggestions based on previously entered commands. 

### zsh-completions

[This](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions) provides completion suggestions below the prompt, in addition to a history menu.

### zsh-syntax-highlighting

[This](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) is used to add syntax highlighting for terminal commands.

## Tiling Window Manager (Yabai)

Note: A tiling window manager is not for everyone, unlike a traditional window manager a tiling window manager is more common on linux operating systems.

As stated above I prefer a tiling window manager. There are not many options out there for macOS since it is more popular on linux. I personally use [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai#)
as I feel it is the best option out there for me. I particularly like how it is the only one currently available that supports [spaces](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/work-in-multiple-spaces-mh14112/mac).

[Configuration File](./yabai/yabairc)

## Keyboard Shortcuts (SKHD)

This is used to define your own keyboard shortcuts. This application is key to using Yabai as it does not have any keyboard shortcuts process built in.

[Configuration file](./skhd/skhdrc)

## NodeJS

When dealing with NodeJS, rather then installing a specific NodeJS version, I prefer to use (Node Version Manager)[https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm]. 

I typically install this with [Homebrew](#homebrew).

After it is install you can install whatever version of NodeJS you need. I typically run `nvm install --lts` which will install the current lts version of NodeJS.

## CSharp
